***E-MARINADE*** (***European water MARINe Alien Data Explorer***) is an interactive *R-Shiny* application designed to help you explore the spread and origin of marine *Non-Indigenous Species* (*NIS*) across European waters.

This tool provides access to harmonized datasets and visualization tools that allow users to:

- 🗺️ Explore where marine NIS have been introduced, by clicking on ecoregions of the European seas.

- 🌍 Visualize their native ranges, to better understand species origins and biogeographic pathways.

- 🐟 Search and select individual species to view detailed maps of their introduced and native distributions.

- 📥 Download datasets for further analysis, and filter tables by taxonomy or geography.

The app combines spatial data, ecological metadata, and interactive maps to support researchers, policymakers, and educators in assessing patterns of biological invasions in marine ecosystems.
